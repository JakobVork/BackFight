\section{PanZoomView}

PanZoomView extends the View class, its responsibility is to handle panning\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panning\_(camera)}, zooming of the view and touch on the screen.

The onTouchEvent from the view class is overridden in the PanZoomView so that zooming can be supported through a custom listener that is extended from the ScaleGestureDetector\footnote{https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ScaleGestureDetector.html}. Every time the screen is touched the onTouchEvent method is called to determine what kind of gesture is made. Zoom happens through a listener that overrides the onScale function which changes the scaleFactor of the canvas and updates the map. When the map gets updated it is scaled based on the scaleFactor. 

Panning is needed for giving the movement of the map a nice flow instead of it jumping to fixed positions when the map is moved. Panning is relevant when a move gesture is made and scaling is not in process. Panning will be handled by setting the position of screen to new coordinates and updating the map multiple times when moved.
