\section{User interface design}
This section will show the ideas about how the application was supposed to look and feel when the design was made in the very beginning of the project.

On \ref{navigation} we see the flow from the main menu and how to create a game and start it.

On \ref{gameLayout} the game view is seen as it was original planed it has been changed a bit under development but the idea of using tiles and players is still the same. There has been added some text to describe rounds and actions left.
