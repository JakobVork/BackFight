Items
There are 3 different kind of items: weapon, armor and non combat.
Items can be picked up but it cost an action. Your own items can be seen if you click on the arrow at the right corner and a list pops out. You can hold unlimited items, but only equip one armor and one weapon and you equip an item by clicking at the item and then press equip.

Weapons is used to kill monsters and have damage stats, it stats can vary for each weapon.
Armors is used for projection against attacks and other sorts of damage.
Non-combat items have different properties, which will be said in their description. But an example is what a player can pass through a wall.
